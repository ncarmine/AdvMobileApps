### Android Weather App

The weather app will allow the user to get weather based off their current location or to search for weather in other cities using the search bar. If time permits, users also will either be able to save their searches and access them in the hamburger menu, or have recent searches in the hamburger menu.

The weather app will pull data from the [Dark Sky](https://forecast.io) API, which graciously provides the following:

* Current weather conditions

* Minute-by-minute forecasts out to one hour

* Day-by-day forecasts out to seven days

* Up to 1000 API calls per day for free

This allows for a lot of possible functionality, both at the end of the project and during the development of the project. This is actually where the idea for doing this as a full project came from. I realized during lab 5 that the Dark Sky API was very interesting a flexible to work with, and that features can be added and removed as time permits without requiring a massive reworking of the project.

I am continuing to use the same app icon as in lab 5, called the Questionboltâ„¢. The app may continue to use the same name, "Weather or Not?", as well.
