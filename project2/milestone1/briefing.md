### Android Weather App

I would like to continue the path of lab5 and create a weather app for Android. Working with the location and weather APIs is interesting, and I'd like to explore this on Android. This would be for use of anyone who wants to find their local weather. There are a lot of individual features you can pack into a weather app, so the size of the project is very scalable. This would allow me to have fairly polished builds througout development.
