## Curators app

A curators app would allow users to share their favorite artists, albums, videos, content creators, and games on one app. The app would serve as a social network of sorts, allowing users/curators to follow other curators. Curators may curate content in one or many categories. Each piece of curated content will contain a link to the source, whether it be an artist profile, an invididual video, or a playlist. These links will go to websites such as YouTube, Vimeo, Soundcloud, and Spotify. Other users would then be able to search for more curators categorically, allowing each person to find more content their interested in, from niche to popular.

Ideally, the data for who is following who and who has posted what links would be stored in a database, but for the purposes of this project, this would likely be stored locally.
