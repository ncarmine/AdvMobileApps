### Redoing Project 1

I will be redoing project 1 nearly from scratch, using Firebase instead of Core Data. Firebase is essentially JSON, which I'm much more comfortable working with. This will also be done in iOS again for the same reason; I know that platform much better than Android.

Since I did not come close to fully fleshing out project 1, all current mockups still stand as features I plan to implement.
